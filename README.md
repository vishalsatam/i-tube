# Local Youtube - I like to call it I-Tube

This app was created because I was tired of the sensory overload
caused due to the number of recommended videos available on the Youtube App.

I found myself constantly watching videos I wasn't really wanting to watch.
But due to human addictive impulses, ended up in Youtube rabbit holes and kept
watching one video after another. Eventually ending up with a lot of wasted time.

This app is super minimalistic and just has a basic search without all the noise from recommended videos,
comments, likes, subscriptions, history, recommendations, playlists, etc. The idea is that you are in control of what
you want to watch and only see the videos that you're interested in.

# Instructions to setup locally

Update the .env file and set the env variable `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` to your API key.

You can find the instructions to generate the API key for the Youtube Data API here.
